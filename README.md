- This project demonstrates exception handling in the context of an Energy Management System (EMS). It includes handling multiple exceptions, re-throwing exceptions, managing resources using try-with-resources, and chaining exceptions. Each team member has been assigned one of these topics to implement. We have also provided unit tests for each class, which are then combined into a test suite.
  Handling Multiple Exceptions: This task covers scenarios where multiple types of exceptions may be thrown in the same block, and how to handle them effectively.

* Implemented by:Aarthisree

- Re-throwing Exceptions: This involves catching exceptions, logging or handling them, and then re-throwing them for further processing.

* Implemented by: Aarthi

- Resource Management: This part focuses on managing resources (like file streams) efficiently using the try-with-resources mechanism.

* Implemented by: Monica

- Chaining Exceptions: Chaining exceptions refers to wrapping one exception inside another to provide more context about an error.

* Implemented by: Daranya

- Unit Testing: Each feature is tested using JUnit. Five unit tests are created for each class to ensure proper exception handling.

- Test Suite: All the unit tests are combined into a test suite for easy execution.
