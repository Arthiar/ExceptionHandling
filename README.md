This project demonstrates exception handling in the context of an Energy Management System (EMS). It includes handling multiple exceptions, re-throwing exceptions, managing resources using try-with-resources, and chaining exceptions. Each team member has been assigned one of these topics to implement. We have also provided unit tests for each class, which are then combined into a test suite.
Handling Multiple Exceptions: This task covers scenarios where multiple types of exceptions may be thrown in the same block, and how to handle them effectively.
Implemented by:Aarthi
Re-throwing Exceptions: This involves catching exceptions, logging or handling them, and then re-throwing them for further processing.
Implemented by: Aarthi
Resource Management: This part focuses on managing resources (like file streams) efficiently using the try-with-resources mechanism.
Implemented by: Monica
Chaining Exceptions: Chaining exceptions refers to wrapping one exception inside another to provide more context about an error.
Implemented by: Daranya
Unit Testing
Each feature is tested using JUnit. Five unit tests are created for each class to ensure proper exception handling
Test Suite
All the unit tests are combined into a test suite for easy execution.
